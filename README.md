# dms-lineup
Create an optimal lineup for the German swim competition DMS. This is a team competition where each swimmer can participate in 5 events max and needs to have a sufficient amount of time between consecutive events to recover. The points scored depend on world record times and not on the places the swimmers achieved (like e.g. in US swimming).
